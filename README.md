# React App

This is a simple React application that serves as a starting point for building web applications using React.

## Features

- Modern JavaScript with ES6+
- Component-based architecture
- State management using React's built-in hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`)
- Easy to extend and customize

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the app:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for better performance.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`

If you need to customize the configuration, you can "eject" the app. **Note: This action is irreversible.**
